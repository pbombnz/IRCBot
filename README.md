# Python IRC Bot Modular Framework 
Prashant Bhikhu (PBombNZ) 2015
## Summary
This is a Python IRC Bot Modular Framework. Unlike other python IRC bots currently available, this is written with standard libraries only; there is not underlying frameworks such as django involved. It already comes with a few irc modules that provides various functionality to users. Additionally, the modular design of the framework allows modules to be easily created and to be loaded into the bot without restarting. 

Please note, this framework was based on one of my earlier attempts at bot creation that was really old, therefore some modules that use APIs might not work due to deprecation
