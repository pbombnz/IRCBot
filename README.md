# Python IRC Modular Framework
By Prashant Bhikhu (PBombNZ)
##Summary
This is a Python IRC Modular Framework. Unlike other python bots, this is written with standard libraries ONLY. There is not underlying frameworks such as django involved. It already comes with a few irc modules that provides various functionality to users. Additionally, the modular design of the framework allows modules to be easily created and to be loaded into the bot without restarting. 
#Things to Know
